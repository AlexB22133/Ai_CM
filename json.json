DEE Actions are blocks compiled C# code that are automatically executed in runtime (they can also be executed manually). To create a DEE, follow these steps: Access the DEE Actions page in the 'Administration' page group and press the New DEE Action button Enter a name for the DEE Action Enter a description for the DEE Action (optional) Enter a classification for the DEE Action (optional) Mark the DEE Action as enabled or disabled. A disabled DEE Action will not be executed neither by the 'Pre' or 'Post' transaction logic Add the DEE Action to as many DEE Action Groups as desired. The DEE Action, if enabled, will be executed automatically as part of the 'Pre' and 'Post' transaction logic Edit the test condition. It must return a boolean value: true means that the action will be executed, whereas false means that the action will not be executed Edit the DEE Action code Press Save. The code will be validated automatically. It can also be explicitly validated at any point by pressing the 'Validate' button.
